//! Source positions and related helper functions.
//!
//! Important concepts in this module include:
//!
//! - the *span*, represented by [`Span`] and related types;
//! - source code as represented by a [`SourceMap`]; and
//! - interned strings, represented by [`Symbol`]s, with some common symbols available statically in
//!   the [`sym`] module.
//!
//! ## Note
//!
//! This API is completely unstable and subject to change.
